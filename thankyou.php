    <p>Thank you so much for donating to The Fuel Rats. As simple as our jobs are in the end, we
    actually have a lot of
    systems in place to help us do our rescues, and the servers they run on amount to over €100 per month. We've got
    rats
    who have fronted the money to keep these servers running, but if you'd like to contribute, that would be
    great!</p>
